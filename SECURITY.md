# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We aim to support the latest released minor versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository if available. If not, contact the maintainers privately (e.g., via a security advisory draft or a private channel) with:
- Description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- A minimal PoC if possible

We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and work on a fix. After a fix is available, weâ€™ll coordinate disclosure.
